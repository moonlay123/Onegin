Olga's admirer came that day:
Driving abreast three horses gray.

Surveying them, she thus doth say:
And starting suddenly doth say:
It is called by the natives "doushegreika," that is to say,
Ah! he has gone the other way"—
"What! Grandison?"—"Yes, certainly!"
And wakened him with the loud cry:
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:

And lo! where lies a marble tomb
He writes upon his parents' tomb,
He found them in an almanac,
Greek names, e.g. Agathon, Philotas, Theodora, Thekla, etc.,
Whene'er he had an aching head;
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
For patience, reader, I must plead!
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
But presently she tried to read;
A little farther please to read
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
An idle anchorite and sad,
At seven in summer rose from bed,
Undressed herself and went to bed
'Tis time for supper, now for bed,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
The two old ladies then embraced
Most by this circumstance offended
Not all will like myself proceed—
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Whene'er across the plain at speed
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
What visions then her fancy thronged—
And in society might shed
Just at that time his father died,
Vice in romance is glorified
But now our minds are mystified
The princess from the sofa cried
Successfully to please her tried,
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
By melancholy fogs concealed.
A hermit's life Oneguine led,
The troop of apparitions fled,
Of London life is "vulgar" called
And heard a voice cry—Why! He's killed!—
The channel of the river stilled
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
A life of fact, not fiction, led—
fast that his sword, projecting from the vehicle, rattled
Surely ye all have overhauled
But kindness from his eye had beamed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
And endless the cotillon seemed
A notoriety proclaimed,
every male added to its number, though this could have formed
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Only her countenance assumed
Where many another hand had signed
And vows will probably be signed:
To arid selfishness resigned,
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
A valuable hostage gained,
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
The fruits of learning and combined
And handsome countenance combined,
A tender couplet he combined,
With intellect, a taste refined,
Now a long branch itself entwined
Constant affection intertwined
If the fond hope I could have fanned
His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned
An explanation: she was scared,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
With Olga; nor of this appeared
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
And many another slily sneered;
Their glory with their heels of red
Singing God knows what maid admired,
The fated nutriment desired;
His ruffian bravery adored,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
And by a partial temper stirred
Oneguine's speeches I abhorred
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
To her an elegy composed.
Or, it may be, the bard had passed

And thoughts of Olga first impressed
Then weeping she sank back distressed
No signs of trouble her accused,
And though her soul might be confused,
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
By daily life deteriorated,
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Awhile this beauty captivated,
Of what he thought and what believed,
Who had for four long years survived
Perceived that he was still beloved,
And as a country damsel roved,
Strictly the Carnival observed,
For first "madame" his wants observed,
But proudly in his song preserved
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
A scant attendance Lenski showed
But from the interview what flowed?
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
That we her constantly betrayed
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?—
"What is your name?" The boor looked dazed,
He found him on the table laid,
And many a day thereafter laid
And, hanging down her head, the maid
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
Adieu she to the matron said
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
Though scarcely following what was said,
And spectacles, his knitting staid
Returning, from his ship amid
She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
As one who bivouacs afield,
And can it be? But late a child

Zaretski, once a bully bold,

Before it ran a stream. Behold!

And the young ladies fortunes told,

To listen to the words you speak,
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
He enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!
He's a freemason, so we think.
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Vladimir closes up his book,
His fist Oneguine fiercely shook
Into accounts would sometimes look,
Calling to mind your icy look
And flowed harmoniously. He took

Within its wave the sounding pail,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail

Bedding is laid out and to all

And gallicisms I love as well

And now philanthropy his soul,

The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
Awaiting on the shore I roam
A wish from place to place to roam,
Of priceless value all things seem
He hath acquired the world's esteem
And true, his pistol's faultless aim

Silent, oracular ye'd see him

verst-posts with milestones and substitute a graveyard for
Upon the fields of Mars a gallant warrior,
She cannot—Eugene oped the door
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Comfort and succour to the poor,

Note 46: Yazykoff, a poet contemporary with Pushkin. He was
Still of his club he member was—
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
In winter, when Night longer holds
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
With bated breath, around she bends
At times my reason almost bends,
No one my anguish comprehends,
With love which happiness extends;
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
Appear attuned to softer chords;
At least their accents and their words
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
The remnant destiny concedes,
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
Sits down and gazes on all sides—
Of migratory gipsy hordes—
The serpent to unlawful trees
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
And nothing more important sees;
Tattiana to the index flies
Ever to hear the same replies
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
She from the winter corn espies
In the world's mortal revelries,
With raspberries, cherries.
The country hath its liberties
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
She got a book of nursery tales,
To banish far unworthy themes
I sail upon my lake at times
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
Attentive be unto my rhymes
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Her head upon her breast declines
Upon her elbow she reclines,
The golden ember now enshrines,
All vanished as an echo goes.
Compassion now or wrath inspires
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
And of the irksome harness tires,
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
All which caprice and affluence craves,
Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
Our liberty at least survives:
To the pianoforte he moves
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
At the same hour she oped her eyes
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
But finally he oped his eyes
Where every day before his eyes
For tallow, wood and other things
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
All this in many cases brings
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
Slow circling round its fellow swings
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
Exceptionless as no rule is,
lyric poet of some originality and talent. The "Feasts" is
Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,
Custom the despot soon prevails.
Which of approaching labour tells
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
And where Thalia softly dreams
Descended swift in turbid streams
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
Glory with which our history teems
A windmill too a jig performs
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
The secrets of maidens.
Disport yourselves, maidens,
To secrets of virgins,
poet complains in a subsequent stanza there were no inns;
Priams of country populations
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
With flame more ardent passion burns,
I will not wed, and ever weeps
Mournful Love's deadly trace appears
Nearer they come—Eugene appears!
And what from its recess appears?
Her weary eyes are filled with tears—
With Eugene pranks of former years
For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,
Old age through spectacles too peers,
And judgment which unsteady veers
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Develops and matures its powers,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And lo! five paces more they pass,
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
And contemplative dreaminess;
With laughter smothered weariness:
In rhyming I show laziness.
Where youth the proper rhyme is fleetness?
Await the long-delayed caress.
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
Conquer by passion and address,
Meantime in matutinal dress
To fawn upon and love express;
Her agitation and distress
Nor discontinued to distress
Hymen's embarrassments, distress,
A strong resemblance these possess—
If wife and children to possess
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
Their coming which no man expects,
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
accommodated for the night, or indeed for as many nights
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
As formerly the shepherd sits
The maiden at her casement sits
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
Ever receive with kindly hearts
 Baratynski Feasts
Though for his Helen Menelaus
And like Napoleons each of us
The stomach doth admonish us.
A critic of the stage malicious,
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
The conversation tedious
With satisfaction marvellous,
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
How mean, how pusillanimous!
Then ye were barely generous,
Well! Làrina appears to us
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
To male acquaintances he bows,
The men salute with lower bows
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
When Passion's fire no longer glows
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
The first appearance of the snows
Alas! the friend of childish days
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat
The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
the accommodation of forty or fifty guests would somewhat
But when two minutes she had sat,
Where I can no more recollect?—
The glass unwittingly inspect
And Christian folk will, I expect,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
The miserable bard to meet,
Where fashionable circles meet
That heart with inspiration sweet
The words and looks of charmers sweet
Wherein I castigation get;
Ah! I still struggle to forget
And by that shady rivulet
When in her walks abroad she met
work entitled "Les trois Irlandais Conjures, ou l'ombre d'Emmet,"
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
On whom a sister's heart was set
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Born of a babbler in a loft
Raises within my breast as oft
China and bronze the tables weight,
Above the yawning grave would fight,—
The curse of commonplace delight.
Abandoning insane delight,
His ardent soul with full delight.
And full of innocent delight,
Blest be the labours of the light,
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
That the two friends with morning's light
The firmament in mellow light,
Terror of guardians of the night;
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
Full many a lovely star hath night
That glimmered through the radiant night
His ditties were as pure and bright
And is it true her garland bright
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
In the first place, say, am I right?
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
I am not worthy them in aught;
If they were similar in aught.

'Tis noisome to her there: in thought
She hears of conversation nought

Calm and without embarrassment,

Being from hell or heaven sent,
Time was, in style magniloquent
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
Oneguine to the window went
An invalid from lung complaint.
In spite of common sense we're wont
Ourselves as unities to count;
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
And consolation soon begot.
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
What once I knew is clean forgot—
To Russ indigenous are not;
Into the district then to boot
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Into the chamber where he slept
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
The indignation of her heart!
A lancer captivates her heart!
But followed the strict rules of art,
The fires of passion and its smart—
And oft in whispers would impart
Their voices nought to her impart
Poetic transport. They impart
By flattery and lover's art—
Which from the devil's bookcase start,
Eugene designed with me to start
As oft to meat and drink advert,
To accompany him and to escort
When the obedient doll in sport
At times to silence would resort,
With pungent or obtuse retort,
There is no fishmarket retort
Vociferously paid her court,
But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,
Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,
Poetical enthusiast,
In Russ her love made manifest,
The credulous indeed are blest,
Let us go seek a little rest—
The body they consigned to rest,
Devoured them with an eager zest.

But I abandoned their array,

In coach or post-cart duly placed

The wedding-day had been arranged,
A breathless silence then, prolonged—
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
He conversation would have led—
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
She never of deception dreamed
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?—
He sang of life's fresh colours stained
At first for books was disinclined,
Tattiana nurse the project planned
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
Into the cups already sped
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
And Tania's husband soon appeared.—
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
The poet from Tamboff secured,
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
The image of her seal impressed.
And kindness Tania was impressed,
But once more pensive and distressed
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
Nor long his mind was agitated
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
The conversation was revived
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
The gifted songster never swerved,
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
And necessary fools allowed.
Titles and ages intermixed.
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
She comprehends. The simple maid
Had rendered him an invalid;
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
I also wandered there of old,
Some marriageable maids behold,
Tattiana in traditions old
No one appeared to lend a hand.
To Love all ages lowly bend,

To help her to the other shore

With childlike lisp will lie to please.

And madrigals I'm asked to write!
To purest love he tuned his note
And an elegiac poem wrote.
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
And all without her husband's leave.
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
And in the Summer Garden rove.
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
Stood as estranged from all aloof,

And led me off to church with song."
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.

To move in fashionable life,
In many things had changed his life—
And leads a solitary life?

And every morning I awake
To burn, yet reason keep awake

And gazed around with eyes of flame;
But fashionable hatred's flame
Of many an economic scheme;
Who reads his visionary theme

All dark and silent hath become;
And shorter had the days become.
I am in love, my hour hath come!
When will my hour of freedom come!
Nor shall the caterpillar come

His name: the tenderness of home
No longer through her former home;

But Lord! from friends deliver me!
Of the domains of the side-scene.
All this was novel to Eugene.
And so departed. But Eugene,
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
The lamps illuminating shine;
'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Never upon my heroine
Long tortured by his lay divine,
About the crop of hay, the wine,
Give me just half a glass of wine—
All to the grand saloon are gone—
Can she have been a moment gone
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
Certainly not Eugene alone
In horror for itself alone,
Moina recalls for this alone
Though around honoured Priam's throne
"Mine!" cried Eugene with savage tone.
Of fashionable dames the foe,
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
'Tis dreadful—ye agree, I hope—
in Athens," "Fingal," "Demetrius Donskoi," and "Polyxena," are
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
Albums magnificent which scare
The vile seducer shall not dare
O Men, how very like ye are
And impiously should declare,
You with stern countenance declare
I cannot help it I declare,
And Eugene soon discovered there
And be not in advance severe.
If the choice in my power were,
And dark and drear the evenings were,
As if impossible it were
Would haste in agitation dire
Authors replete with sacred fire
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
And our swift troikas never tire;
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
And the young girl appeared before
He was deceived. Just as before
Society renounced once more.
As if against obstruction sore
In history he took no pleasure,
Found out the secret how at pleasure
For long—for ever. To be sure
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
Felled a calumniator base!
"Can I inspect the mansion, please?"
Possession hath no power to please,
In motley and amusing chase.
The curs away to kennel chase,
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Not even a poetic phrase,
Eugene would speak regarding these.
She mourned and to the moon would raise
Of passion they so often raise.
And where the billows hoarsely raise
They growl a bit—they scandalise—
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
Tired by the ball's incessant noise,
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
We hear with interest intense
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
And where at last his bones repose
Readers expect the rhyme of rose,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Too much I'm given to intersperse,
I once forgot for your sweet cause
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
Night separated from her spouse,
The drum already doth arouse.
 Indifferent and sedate,
The Lovelaces are out of date,
On Lenski's matrimonial fate
Sometime collected, shall relate
"But tell me, nurse, can you relate
"He hath neglected us of late."—
How soon he learnt to titillate
And jests doth recapitulate.
Just at the hour we designate
The Làrinas would celebrate,
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
Eternally to imitate
My heart of old would captivate.
In bud of promise incomplete,
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
The girl in marriage they unite.
But I must add to what I write
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
I on my chosen hero dote;
With "vale" finish off a note;
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
This anchorite amid his waste
Device of rural minds acute!
From whose analysis minute
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
Without the faintest trace to leave
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
A first success light pinions gave,
The prejudices all men have,
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
A prudent man like you and brave
My guardian angel to the grave.
The Lord deliver her and save!
These are your relatives, believe:
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
What I by relatives conceive?
When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
Applause, the people's donative.
Along the hall, and high above
That guests approach: and when above
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
None, be my witness Heaven above!
And enmity and hope and love—
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Time was when cold seduction strove
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
Him who inspired both love and awe,
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
To arm the tongue and e'en the eye,
And reads with rapid eager eye
To raise his pistol to his eye,
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Who now could fail to recognize
Our union would produce but grief.

And solitude and calm delight,

When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
There came a sudden flash of light,
Aurora's ruddy rays of light—

And showed with an uncertain light
Yet clearer shines than every light

Of sunset glow with rosy light,

The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
