A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.82
A ball here, there a children's treat,
And a romance in ancient style
A dagger, asterisk, or note
A ball in Peter's capital,
A first success light pinions gave,
And in the final tome we learnt,
And vanish like a bird in air.
But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,
Abandon cities riotous,
A bastard fame prohibited?
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
And cannot anything conceal,
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
And blest me, sinking to the grave.78
And glasses unemployed all night;
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
About the crop of hay, the wine,
Above the yawning grave would fight,—
At eighteen not to play the fool!
A curious interest disclose
Ah! it may be, affection true
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
Alas! how wretched now my lot!"
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
All this, my friends, translate aright:
And shall adopt some new caprice.
And a malicious epigram
And if Tattiana mine had found—
And madrigals I'm asked to write!
But now our minds are mystified
And in addition youth is flame
A beau is for Tattiana found!
according to the forms of the Eastern Church. See Note 28.
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Alas! he loved as in our times
A country damsel's album trim,
Always together, eventide
And blest the shadows of the night.
And all thy precious elegies,
And at the altar of their fame
And now philanthropy his soul,
Blest be the labours of the light,
Although we know that Eugene had
an author of promise—unfulfilled.
And an habitual sense of pain;
And an encouragement did breathe
And bless mankind with full delight.
And by a partial temper stirred
And heedless of approval seems,
And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
At twenty who was prig or swell,
And Eugene soon discovered there
And my Tattiana now began
And now his youthful heart desires
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
And ought he not to disregard
And rapid whirl of many feet,
Around the meadow and the grove.
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
Behold! than polished floor more nice
Acquaintance instantly to make.
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
aims a stroke at the pedantic and narrow-minded criticism to

And flowed harmoniously. He took
And hates the world's discordant ways.
Affectionately yours till death.
A flimsy trace of musings past
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
And a guitar produced we see,
A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!
And by that shady rivulet
And deem the world perfection is!
And for a time our course delay,
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
A few of different temper deemed,
Again her rural life she sought,
And judgment which unsteady veers
A game of chess would often play,
Ah! he has gone the other way"—
A horse's hoofs she hears—She shrinks!
All this was novel to Eugene.
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
Albums magnificent which scare
All mothers their sweet girls believed
A million bipeds reckons thus
And elbows on the table they
And eye which gleams with inspiration—
And grant success to labour long;
And in a whisper did repeat:
And life and fate in turn selected
And like Napoleons each of us
And numerous pages had preserved
And on the last one, underlined:
And Schiller read by candlelight.
A register of fleeting thought,
A tender couplet he combined,
Attentive listened to the lad.
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
And spouted it with lyric fire—
And triumphs in career erotic.
And the lime alley's twilight dim
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And who the rent-roll of his race
And when her violence reviewed—
A Vampire fond of meditation,
And wisely gallops to the hill.
An exile from their troublous reign,
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
Assuredly should not have been
Around my stanzas incomplete
A tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Better than Chateaubriand did
Buried in meditation deep,
But more the passions occupy
But one thought only filled his mind,
Abandoned he his country seat,
"Abandon hope for ever here!"38
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
A beauty languidly at rest,
Across her youth a shade had come,
Abandoning insane delight,
A bearded postillion astride
A bottle of a vintage white
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
A case of books he doth obtain—
Accents of rapture or despair
Across the smiling face of dawn.
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
A book at early morn perused.
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
Absorbed in melancholy mood
accommodated for the night, or indeed for as many nights
Adieu she to the matron said
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A hermit's life Oneguine led,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A finished madrigal would frame
Against my inclination, friends,
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
All overtures of friendship ended.
And lo! he is already there!
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
A joyous troop of little boys
A lady's hand doth never kiss.
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
All about Olga—to a light
All vanished as an echo goes.
And about dawn upon his breast
"And is it long since back he came?
A life of fact, not fiction, led—
All silently hung down his head.
All that perfection could desire;
All visited him at first, of course;
All this I know is out of date,
And all with one accord agreed,
And as a country damsel roved,
And clad in airy costume took
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
And from the misty woodland nigh
And in her hand a French romance.
And in her languid bosom raise
And many a caravan on high
And many another slily sneered;
And meditative from the spot
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
Alone amid possessions great,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
And by a sweet delusion he
And distance interposed in vain,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
And full of innocent delight,
Already by repentance moved
And a boy handed round the cream.
And handsome countenance combined,
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
And after them at headlong pace
And her bespangled robe doth wave
And not a speck of dirt descried.
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Also one Viázemski, remarking
A mournful temper on his Muse.
And cares not farther to proceed;
An almanac but eight years old.
And an old gent the poet marking
And breathe a drama in his ear.
And leaning 'gainst the portal closed
And courtier, fop, and usurer
And finally, upon his bed
And fled afar—she followed me.
And herds of oxen wandering low;
And mental elasticity.
And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
And reads with rapid eager eye
And shorter had the days become.
And solitude and calm delight.
And stoves of various shapes abound.
And solitude and calm delight,
And think: here lies who loved me well,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
And where Thalia softly dreams
And views amongst themselves advance
A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,
But from the interview what flowed?
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
A worthy object 'tis, and well
But finally grew bored by her.
But in the drawing-room all appeared
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Approach, approach; I am thine own."
As a poetic life serene,
A promenade in twilight late
As when the tempest's veil is drawn
Authors replete with sacred fire
As in a thicket's humble shade,
A substitute for lamps we hail!
At forty suffered from the gout,
At thirty who was married well,
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade
Bright day will then begin to burn,
But the dark sepulchre I may
Being from hell or heaven sent,
Beneath her parents' eyes the maid
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
But enough! Now, 'tis my intent
But now in her effulgence pale
Of fashionable dames the foe,
And such unconsciously he led,
And supercilious dames she glides,
And the young revellers of past times
And where the billows hoarsely raise
And where may be her sister now?
A new proprietor arrived,
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
And tears of reconciliation:
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
And thus unto her nurse did say:
And traces with a slender finger
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
Longtime was her heart desolate
And that too often we receive
And the cast-iron statuette
And the extent of his caprice;
And the heart's agitated dreams.
And the world met her smilingly,
And the young damsel from the town,
And wild among them grew her words—
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
At early morn returns the maid
Behold! the world's opinion!63
As if he cruelly had joked!
At seven in summer rose from bed,
At the front gates, but in brief space
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
A young and handsome galliard.
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Burger, b. 1748, d. 1794.
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And wild festivities among
Assemblies oligarchical
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
A vision desolate and drear
And then a cup of coffee drank,
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
Because he yawned at the bare view
And these the attentive maid observed
And town and friends forgotten quite.
As lordly mansions ought to be,
And turned to leave immediately,
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
But Eugene, incontestably,
But Olga would not such peruse.
But this is my advice, 'twere best
And usually despised it too,
Another passed; 'twas just the same.
A pensive sorrow in her glance
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Before such fond simplicity
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
And various chords upon it proves,
And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
A thick immense neglected grove
And vows will probably be signed:

A friar black approaching near,50
Again imagination blazed,
Amid sly, pusillanimous
And also that my feeble verse—
And oft its Dictionary thumb.13
A coquette loves by calculation,
A crab upon a spider rides,
Amid the awful emptiness
And flooded all the level ground.
A critic of the stage malicious,
And also fashionable beaux.
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And this fifth canto ought to be
A notoriety proclaimed,
A little virgin mirror peeps.
Amid the soulless sons of pride
An ardent heart and yet so mild?—
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
And sulked in silent indignation;
And through the lofty windows views
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
A fop, in dress pedantical.
A hand of ice appeared to seize62
Again the plague of boyhood—love?
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
All that the heart would fain express—
All to the grand saloon are gone—
All with urbanity betray,
A marriageable maid matured,
Amid coquettes who pray to God
And "Agathon" replied, amazed.53
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
And far removed from rumour vain;
And from his dressing-room would pass
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
And I, remembering Svetlana,54
And in the bathroom did command
And happy unto you appear.
And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.55
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
A prudent man like you and brave
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
And stupid censors passionate;
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
An honourable course ye took,
A passionate desire to bend
A print without the picture's grace,
An idle anchorite and sad,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
A while ago the winter spent,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
Adieu! whate'er thou didst desire
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
A feeble version read below,
After the wedded couple strain;
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
All to the doctors Eugene send,
Also their feet—yet ne'ertheless
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
A hidden train of wild desire.
Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
All is foreseen. My secret drear
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Alas! the friend of childish days
A little farther please to read
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
Already he grew phthisical.
Although the destined coffin nears,
And at economy was great;
And be not in advance severe.
And then with blind credulity
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
A lover's letter might convey,
And female tears hysterical,
Age immature averse to cheat—
And following them ye might espy
And gently hovered o'er my head?
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
All are amazed; but Lenski he
And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
Are admirable, my dear friend,
And in society might shed
All covered up with snow in heaps,
All this may be an empty dream,
Also my wretched liberty
Amid the company career.
And contemplative dreaminess;
And due precautions take betimes.
And a determined disposition,
And by the fiddle's rushing sound
Appear attuned to softer chords;
A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
And, joy of souls effeminate,
And marking Tania's agitation,
And swifter than the swallow's flight.
And Lenski followed—a light broke—
And long her eyes as through a haze
And pressed her hand—the crimson blush
And spur my spirit's torpid mood!
And they the waters recommend.
Approaches Olga and the pair
And thou, youth's early inspiration,
And to these letters and these tears.
A pair; though desolate my mind,
Anticipating woe she pined,
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
Around the carriage of the pair—
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
Because her passion wanted art,
At times three words to him addressed
As giddy youth's hilarity—
as his predecessor in song, though he certainly did not plead
Attentive be unto my rhymes
A smile from slumbering nature clear
As your light footprints on the green.
At least their accents and their words
At a great feast against desire,
Because she was so innocent,
At least by show of sympathy;
Before whose inexperienced sight
A timid love to banishment?—
At morn I must assuredly
Away, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.
Attend in male attire arrayed.
Aurora's ruddy rays of light—
Back to his regiment must roam.
Become alarmed. So never mind!
Avenge himself in proper style.
Because in singleness of thought
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Before you agonized to die—
Begins to talk of this and that,
being waged between two hostile schools of Russian men of
But now—what brings you to my feet?—
Across the stage still madly sweep,
Almost became a poet say—
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
And soon imagination threw
Bear gone—she at the threshold placed;
And bitter torment never known.
And testy gamesters do engage
A strong resemblance these possess—
As formerly the shepherd sits
A mansion—by the window, see!
And heard a voice cry—Why! He's killed!—
And now upon the snow in thaw
And her upon the threshold laid.
And now he views forgotten foes,
And the young girl appeared before
an ode, "To Her," which commences thus:
As one who bivouacs afield,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
Adroitly seized and carried her;
A dying man with art to soothe,
All sons of mental weariness.
And by degrees upon him grew
And his poor basten sandal knits.
A hidden meaning could impart,
"Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!"—
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
and Malinniki.
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
Applause, the people's donative.
Are ye replaced by other maids
A tangled wilderness around.
At Russ she was by no means clever
At first, I clung to secrecy:
Away her golden earrings tore;
A young man motionless he saw,
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Before him her wild game of chance.

A faithful friend to friends, of ladies torturer,
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
And to revive Tattiana seemed.

A due which must to earth be paid.

As bees who leave their dainty store
Affection how did you requite?

A forest now she sees in front
Again in her ethereal dance?
And still the coachmen round the fires11
And what from its recess appears?
Again a century should scourge

Ah no! no faintness her attacked
A love which knew no limitation,
And all in snow is buried deep.

And the cold beauties of the season:

Between the stalls, along the toes;
Books he abandoned like the fair,

Both were expectant of the hate

But better loved the soft repose
But at a later, sterile age,
But gray Phillippevna the door
But lo! the friends to chat commence.

But at her shriek ran forth with noise
But nowhere can she find repose,
But I must add to what I write
Not even a poetic phrase,

His tea with rum no more desired,

His weary head declined at rest,

Her passion's faithful counterpart,

Her movements, voice and figure slight,

He thought to write, but labour long
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks

The principal outlines of these three poems are as follows: A
The wedding-day had been arranged,

Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,

The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
They growl a bit—they scandalise—
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
The prejudices all men have,
There jars of cider block the way,

Though scarcely following what was said,
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
The Russian peasants are childishly fond of whirligigs, which

Thus age approached, the common doom,

Thus having braved Apollo's rage
This was his social character.

They blossom, ripen and they fall

They stir the heart as heretofore.

Was it not thou who thus didst stoop

When Passion's fire no longer glows
When separation's hour drew nigh,
Where melancholy rocks arise
Where plentifully feelings flow
Which glowed with virginal desire.
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
When, wise at length, we seek repose
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Wherein love innocently pines.

Whom vice, if named, doth agitate

Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Whose qualities appeared to afford

Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
